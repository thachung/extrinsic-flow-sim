= Curve Shortening Flow (CSF)
:showtitle: true
:stem: latexmath

== Overview
A family of curve \(\gamma : S^1 \times [0,T) \to \mathbb{R}^2\) is said to evolve under curve shortening flow if it satisfies the following PDE:
\[\frac{\partial \gamma}{\partial t} = \vec{\kappa}.\]
The code in this repository simulates the evolution given a closed initial curve \(\gamma_0\) under CSF using a semi-implicit Euler time stepping for the time discretization and a finite difference method for the curvature calculation.
